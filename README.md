🎮 MEDIQUEST

A passion project built by friends — created openly, shared proudly, and developed as a learning journey.

🧪 About the Game

MEDIQUEST is a collaborative passion project between myself and my friends.
The goal is simple:
to build a fun, creative game while learning every major skill involved in game development — from coding and systems design to art, animation, and project structure.

This project is not just about finishing a game.
It’s about becoming a better developer, artist, and creator.

The game will be similar to Hades in the story-path and similar to Enter the Gungeon in art style. The game features our main character, Perry, he is a farmer in the outskirts of a massive kingdom and after the King's absurd taxation of his village's crop, his parents sadly die of starvation.
It is this moment which begins Perry's journey of revenge, and in an almost Lord of the Rings style journey, he will PARRY and fight his way to the kingdom.(Btw parrying will be a major combat feature)

📚 Learning in Public

I’m using this project as a long-term journey to learn:

Game programming

Digital art + animation

Project management

Creative collaboration

Content creation and media storytelling

To stay accountable and to grow my skills, I’ll be documenting the entire process across social media.
By sharing my progress publicly, I hope to:

Improve my communication and media skills

Build an audience around the project

Help other beginners learn alongside me

Inspire others to start their own creative journeys

If you’re here to learn from the code, watch the development progress, or just see what’s happening behind the scenes — welcome.

🔓 Code License

🤝 Contributing
I want to involve my audience in the process of building my game in hopes of not only bettering my game, but helping them learn in the process.
This is primarily a personal learning project, but feedback, suggestions, and pull requests are always welcome.
If something inspires you or helps you learn — that’s exactly what this repo is here for.

🌟 Follow the Journey

I’ll be posting regular updates, devlogs, and reacting to your ideas across my social platforms.
